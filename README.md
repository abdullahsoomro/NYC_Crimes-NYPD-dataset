# NYC_Crimes-NYPD-dataset
  
New York City has a population of 8.5 million people. Once known as the "murder capital", NYC crime, especially murder rates, has decreased in that last two decades. However, crime has not stopped, so it's important to know when, where, and what crimes are taking place. It is especially important to know what kind of crimes happen where. Thus, we're going to embark on an exploratory data analysis of crime complaints in NYC and make predictions about crimes in Brooklyn.

In this repository, we will examine and analyze crime complaints in New York City. We will start off by data munging and feature engineering. Then perform data visualization to get a better understanding of the data. Finally, we will perform predictive modeling to make predictions about future events based on the current data. In doing so, we will answer questions such as:

- What kinds of crimes are most prevalent in NYC? Brooklyn?
- Where does crime take place?
- Are there certain times when crime is more likely to occur? If so, when?
- What are the most common crimes?
- Can we predict where and when a crime will occur?
- Can we predict who is mostly likely to be a victim of a crime?
